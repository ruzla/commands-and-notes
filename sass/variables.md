# VARIABLES

  Think of variables as a way to store information that you want to reuse
  throughout your stylesheet. You can store things like colors, font stacks,
  or any CSS value you think you'll want to reuse. Sass uses the $ symbol to
  make something a variable. Here's an example:

     $font-stack:    Helvetica, sans-serif;
     $primary-color: #333;

     body {
       font: 100% $font-stack;
       color: $primary-color;
     }

  When the Sass is processed, it takes the variables we define for the
  $font-stack and $primary-color and outputs normal CSS with our variable
  values placed in the CSS. This can be extremely powerful when working with
  brand colors and keeping them consistent throughout the site.

     body {
       font: 100% Helvetica, sans-serif;
       color: #333;
     }

 # EXERCISE

  Write a stylesheet that defines a variable $color, sets its value to
  '#000', and uses it to set the color style of the body element.

 ## HINTS

  To make a Sass (SCSS) stylesheet, create a new file with a .scss extension
  and start writing SCSS. When you are done, you must run:

     $ learn-sass verify stylesheet.scss

  to proceed. Your stylesheet will be tested, a report will be generated,
  and the lesson will be marked 'completed' if you are successful.
