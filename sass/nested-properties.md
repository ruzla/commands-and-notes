# NESTED PROPERTIES

  CSS has quite a few properties that are in “namespaces;” for instance,
  font-family, font-size, and font-weight are all in the font namespace. In
  CSS, if you want to set a bunch of properties in the same namespace, you
  have to type it out each time. Sass provides a shortcut for this: just
  write the namespace once, then nest each of the sub-properties within it.
  For example:

     .funky {
       font: {
         family: fantasy;
         size: 30em;
         weight: bold;
       }
     }

  is compiled to:

     .funky {
       font-family: fantasy;
       font-size: 30em;
       font-weight: bold; }

  The property namespace itself can also have a value. For example:

     .funky {
       font: 20px/24px fantasy {
         weight: bold;
       }
     }

  is compiled to:

     .funky {
       font: 20px/24px fantasy;
         font-weight: bold;
     }

 # EXERCISE

  Define a selector .sassy, and use nested properties to set border-width to
  '10px', border-color to 'red' and border-radius to '5px'.

 ## HINTS

  To make a Sass (SCSS) stylesheet, create a new file with a .scss extension
  and start writing SCSS. When you are done, you must run:
