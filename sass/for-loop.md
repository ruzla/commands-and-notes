 # FOR LOOP

  The @for directive repeatedly outputs a set of styles. For each
  repetition, a counter variable is used to adjust the output. The directive
  has two forms: @for $var from <start> through <end> and @for $var from
  <start> to <end>. Note the difference in the keywords through and to. $var
  can be any variable name, like $i; <start> and <end> are SassScript
  expressions that should return integers. When <start> is greater than
  <end> the counter will decrement instead of increment.

  The @for statement sets $var to each successive number in the specified
  range and each time outputs the nested styles using that value of $var.
  For the form from ... through, the range includes the values of <start>
  and <end>, but the form from ... to runs up to but not including the value
  of <end>. Using the through syntax,

     @for $i from 1 through 3 {
       .item-#{$i} { width: 2em * $i; }
     }

  is compiled to:

     .item-1 {
       width: 2em; }
     .item-2 {
       width: 4em; }
     .item-3 {
       width: 6em; }

 # EXERCISE

  Write rules for the elements h1 through h6 that set their font-size to be
  24px minus 3px times the heading level, i.e. h1 would have a font-size of
  24px - 3px * 1 equal to 21px, using the @for directive.

 ## HINTS

  To make a Sass (SCSS) stylesheet, create a new file with a .scss extension
  and start writing SCSS. When you are done, you must run:

     $ learn-sass verify stylesheet.scss
