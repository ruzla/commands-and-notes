# EXTEND/INHERITANCE

  This is one of the most useful features of Sass. Using @extend lets you
  share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another. It helps keep
  your Sass very DRY. In our example we're going to create a simple series
  of messaging for errors, warnings and successes.

     .message {
       border: 1px solid #ccc;
       padding: 10px;
       color: #333;
     }

     .success {
       @extend .message;
       border-color: green;
     }

     .error {
       @extend .message;
       border-color: red;
     }

     .warning {
       @extend .message;
       border-color: yellow;
     }

  What the above code does is allow you to take the CSS properties in
  .message and apply them to .success, .error, & .warning. The magic happens
  with the generated CSS, and this helps you avoid having to write multiple
  class names on HTML elements. This is what it looks like:

     .message, .success, .error, .warning {
       border: 1px solid #cccccc;
       padding: 10px;
       color: #333;
     }

     .success {
       border-color: green;
     }

     .error {
       border-color: red;
     }

     .warning {
       border-color: yellow;
     }

 # EXERCISE

  Write a rule for the selector .push-button with a background-color: blue,
  and a rule for the selector .main-button so that it extends .push-button,
  and also sets the font-weight: bold.

 ## HINTS

  To make a Sass (SCSS) stylesheet, create a new file with a .scss extension
  and start writing SCSS. When you are done, you must run:

     $ learn-sass verify stylesheet.scss
