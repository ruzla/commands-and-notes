 # PARENT SELECTOR

  Sometimes it’s useful to use a nested rule’s parent selector in other ways
  than the default. For instance, you might want to have special styles for
  when that selector is hovered over or for when the body element has a
  certain class. In these cases, you can explicitly specify where the parent
  selector should be inserted using the & character.

  & will be replaced with the parent selector as it appears in the CSS. This
  means that if you have a deeply nested rule, the parent selector will be
  fully resolved before the & is replaced. For example:

     #main {
       color: black;
       a {
         font-weight: bold;
         &:hover { color: red; }
       }
     }

  is compiled to:

     #main {
       color: black; }
       #main a {
         font-weight: bold; }
         #main a:hover {
           color: red; }

 # EXERCISE

  Write a rule for the button element setting its color to 'black', and use
  the parent selector & to set its color to 'red' when the element has
  focus, via pseudo selector :focus.

 ## HINTS

  To make a Sass (SCSS) stylesheet, create a new file with a .scss extension
  and start writing SCSS. When you are done, you must run:

     $ learn-sass verify stylesheet.scss
