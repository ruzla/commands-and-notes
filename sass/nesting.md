 # NESTING

  When writing HTML you've probably noticed that it has a clear nested and
  visual hierarchy. CSS, on the other hand, doesn't. Here's an example of
  some typical styles for a site's navigation:

     nav {
       ul {
         margin: 0;
         padding: 0;
         list-style: none;
       }

       li { display: inline-block; }

       a {
         display: block;
         padding: 6px 12px;
         text-decoration: none;
       }
     }

  You'll notice that the ul, li, and a selectors are nested inside the nav
  selector. This is a great way to organize your CSS and make it more
  readable. When you generate the CSS you'll get something like this:

     nav ul {
       margin: 0;
       padding: 0;
       list-style: none;
     }

     nav li {
       display: inline-block;
     }

     nav a {
       display: block;
       padding: 6px 12px;
       text-decoration: none;
     }

 # EXERCISE

  Write a stylesheet that sets margin: 0 to the ul, and color of links to
  red for elements contained within an aside element, using nesting.

 ## HINTS

  To make a Sass (SCSS) stylesheet, create a new file with a .scss extension
  and start writing SCSS. When you are done, you must run:

     $ learn-sass verify stylesheet.scss

  to proceed. Your stylesheet will be tested, a report will be generated,
  and the lesson will be marked 'completed' if you are successful.
